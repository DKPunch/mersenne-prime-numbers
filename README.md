# Mersenne Prime Number Generator

This was a project assigned to me about half way into my first term
of a Computer Science course. The assignment required that we have
the program output any Mersenne Prime Numbers up to a certain point.
A prime number is defined as being a "Mersenne Prime" if it is of the 
form 2^n – 1, where n is any integer greater than 1. 

As an example, a prime number is represented when  n = 5 in the formula 
2^n – 1. Therefore 2^5 is 32, minus 1 is 31. The number 31 is a prime number. 
The program will compute the value of 2^n – 1 for all integers starting 
at n = 1 and will continue until n = 19. If the result is a prime number, 
then it is a Mersenne Prime and it will be printed as output.
